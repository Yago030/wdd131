      <h2>Site Name</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Triadesoft</strong> is a software development company driven by
        purpose and built on solid roots. While we work with all kinds of
        businesses, we have a deep commitment to supporting rural entrepreneurs,
        cooperatives, and local NGOs. We believe in using technology to create
        meaningful impact — empowering communities through scalable, thoughtful
        solutions.

      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this website is to professionally present Triadesoft,
        highlight the services we offer, and connect with projects that need
        digital solutions with real-world impact. The site will serve as a
        landing page to reach potential clients, showcase case studies, and
        invite collaboration — especially from cooperatives, NGOs, and rural
        ventures.

        <li>
          <strong>Agricultural entrepreneur:</strong> "I produce artisanal honey
          and want to sell online, but I don’t know where to start. Can
          Triadesoft help me set up my online store?"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rural educational NGO:</strong> "We've been working with
          children in the countryside for 10 years, but no one knows our impact.
          We need to show what we do to gain more donations."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dairy cooperative:</strong> "We are 30 producers working
          together and still manage everything on paper. We want a system to
          help us organize and sell directly to consumers."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Agroecological project:</strong> "We grow organic and want to
          educate about sustainable agriculture. We need a website to tell our
          story and sell our products."
